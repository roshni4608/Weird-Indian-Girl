   <h1>Weird Indian Girl Tales</h1> 
    
   <p> Weird Indian Girl Tales is a slice of life and comedy webtoon based on funny instances in my life. The webtoon had been in my mind for 1 year before I officially published it. I wanted to create something I could make quickly to get started with making comics (before starting something big like a fantasy webtoon). I had started working on this webtoon previously but then had stopped when school started. In quarantine I got the time to finally work on it and publish it on webtoons. I had low expectations since I had never been an expert in marketing but was surprised by the love and support I got. Thank you!</p>
